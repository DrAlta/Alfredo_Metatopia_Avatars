Avatars for Alfredo Metatopia

DrAlta1.blend.7z should be the latest.

They where made by the Emperor Artisimo Renderus VII. 
I'm not sure if the Tiger and Dragon are finished in this version  Butthe human mesh to base future avatars off of isshould be finished.  It's basically a Reimplimentation of SL's Ruth with a few more morphs.  I'm I only know how to edit vertices and faces in blender but it seems to be good.

They aren't rigged but should be UV mapped.
