Avatars for Alfredo Metatopia

# /source/DrAlta1.blend.7z
This should be the latest verson.

They where made by the Emperor Artisimo Renderus VII. 

I'm not sure if the Tiger and Dragon are finished in this version  But the human mesh to base future avatars off of is be finished.  It's basically a Reimplimentation of SL's Ruth with a few more morphs.  I'm I only know how to edit vertices and faces in blender but it seems to be good.

It's not rigged or textured yet as it was made only as a reference for what the blendshapes should like like.

An easy task would be to texture and/or rig it and turn it into an actual avatar. 

# rig.blend
This has an armature with the bones used by the motion retargeting system. all animation should have these bones in them; once we get the scriting system We'll start adding scriptst to avatars so that they can take these bones as a control rig.

Note: The fingers are for human-like hands, Wi'll actual anoting the animations with hand gesture(e.g. pointing, fist, pushing, pressing, griping, etc.) and meta-data(where it points at, the shape of the object being held, etc.)
